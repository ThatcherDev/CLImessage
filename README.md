# CLImessage
CLImessage is a command line interface SMS text messaging program.

## Features
CLImessage allows the sending and receiving of SMS text messages to and from a computer using a G-Mail account.
This is done by sending emails to an address that forwards them to a phone number.

When run for the fist time, CLImessage:
- Creates directory 'userdata' to store user information and conversations.
- Prompts user for G-Mail account credentials and stores them in 'userdata/creds.properties'.
- Allows the creation of new conversations.

When creating a conversation, CLImessage:
- Prompts user for name and phone number of new conversation.
- Gets the email address that forwards to this phone number.
- Opens the messenger and allows sending and receiving of messages.
- Logs sent and received messages to 'userdata/ConversationName-Number.convo'.

When opening a previously created conversation, CLImessage:
- Opens the messenger and allows sending and receiving of messages.
- Displays the last 10 logged messages.
- Logs all sent and received messages.

Other features:
- When receiving a message, CLImessage will play a notification sound.
